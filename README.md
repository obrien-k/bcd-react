#BigCom.dev
This obviously needs a lot of work, but the components are there.

The goal of this project is to display BigCommerce's APIs in use with other CMS/server-less/etc. use-cases.

The current state of this is dependent on another [project](https://github.com/obrien-k/whisklist) while still in pursuit, which after time became more realized as this project has progressed.

Currently, this installs what I've been able to determine the most minimal implementation of react/react-dom as well as babel and webpack. Of course this uses my current understanding of BigDesign concepts and will require refinement.

##Instructions
//TODO
Be sure to use npm i -D for dev dependencies.
