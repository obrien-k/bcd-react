#BigCom.DEV

The goal of this project is to display BigCommerce's APIs in use with other CMS/server-less/etc. The current state of the sidebar is dependent on another [project](https://github.com/obrien-k/whisklist) while still in pursuit. It currently showcases Gatsby, WordPress, and Drupal (albeit, I need to configure this for easier access). Vue should be added soon.

This installs a  minimal implementation of React/React-DOM, Babel and Webpack. It also uses BigDesign concepts, that I intend to update.

##Instructions

//TODO

Development

Use the command `npm i -D` to install dev dependencies, and `npm run start` to start a dev server. This will auto-open your default web browser to the dev server.

Production

//TODO

This is running via Netlify on [BigCom.DEV](https://bigcom.dev).

Use the command `npm run build` to create a bundle.js in your dist directory.
